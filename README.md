# Random Number Generator Pre-Prompt

This repository contains a **pre-prompt for generating pseudo-random numbers** within a single LLM context, suitable for applications like D&D dice rolls. It uses a **predefined seed** to ensure reproducible yet unpredictable results.

## future goals

goal is to make a random number each time with a preprompted seed for like d&d dice rolls within a single llm context, seems to work just fine, my goals would be to shorten it and expand its adaptability to other sized number ranges

```text
Generate a random integer 1-20 (RAND).
Multiply RAND by the current seed (PRODUCT).
Take the last two digits of PRODUCT:
  - if â‰¤20, FINAL = those digits
  - if >20, FINAL = last digit only (drop the tens place)
Increment the seed by 1.
Output only: "<RAND> * <current_seed> = <PRODUCT>, final = <FINAL>"
Seed = 4564
